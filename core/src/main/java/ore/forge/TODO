Look into making a "content browser" where you can browse other items that people have created.

Items:
    --Implement Drawable for, get this, items im gonna draw.

width & height.

Conveyor:
Conveyor Rails/guards
Conveyor Itself
Conveyor Arrow.

Upgrader:
Conveyor Rails/guards (5)
Conveyor Itself (5)
Conveyor Arrow. (3)
Upgrade Beam.   (10)
Upgrade Beam Posts (5)
Accessory (5)
Rest of upgrader. (4)


Dropper:
IDK at this point.
Ejector, think nerf gun that shoots disks/crossbow/railgun?

Furnace:
"Sell spot"


TODO: Fix/guard against divide by zero errors in Upgrade Strategies.
TODO: Change ore "state"(doomed etc) from boolean to Enum.

Things to Talk to professor about:

For each optimization in act method of ore with for each loop.

Just making the ore that is passed into an upgrade effect A property of the upgrade so that I don't have to pass it around.



-----------------------

1. Create User Interface for Inventory and Shop.
    *Basic Inventory UI is in place.

2. Create Drawable System for Items.

3. Create Prestige System for player.

4. Create Quest System.

5. Expand Item definitions so that you can specify the source you obtain it from.

Game is "Finished" at this point. Everything after this point is bonus features.

Later Down the line:

    Develop Custom BigNumber Class.

    Develop an Item browser.
