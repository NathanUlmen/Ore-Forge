Look into implementing MongoDB so I can "update" and add new items to game.

Look into making a "content browser" where you can browse other items that people have created.

Look into writing a "physics" driven system for ore movement.

        Handle physics on a seperate thread so that it can but updated on a fixed interval.
        Use interpolation via integration if I decide to do this so that physics wont look weird with different frame rates.
        vs.
        Handle physics on current/same thread but it looses some "precision".


        General Tools:
        Equations of motion.

        Ore Collision, have no clue how to handle this.
            -Conservation of momentum and collision in 2D


1. Is this even a good Idea?

2. Is it possible to write one that has a time complexity less than n^2?

3.
