# OreForge

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

## The Game 
In Ore Forge you assemble your tycoon out of tons of unique items. Each time you prestige you gain access to increasingly
powerful and unique items. 

## Controls:

## Adding/Creating Your Own Custom Items
* You can use [this](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge-Item-Json-Generator) tool to generate item data for the project.

### Key Components:
* The [GameWorld](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/blob/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Screens/GameWorld.java) class is where the bulk of the game is driven from.
* Under the [Strategies Folder](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/tree/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Strategies) you can find the classes that are responsible upgrade logic and effect logic.
  * (I'm especially proud of this aspect of the project).
* The [Ore](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/blob/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Ore.java) class is pretty important as it's what the game revolves around.
